# CHLOE Contributing Guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community
approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening
an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting Started

Check out [`github.com/chloe-game`](https://github.com/chloe-game) to see what
types of contributions we're looking for. The list is not exhaustive...if you
have a skill you think will help, we'd love to see it!

### Issues

#### Create a New Issue

If you spot a problem, have a question, etc., please check for an
[existing issue](https://github.com/chloe-game/chloe-unity/issues) first. If you
don't see one, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/chloe-game/chloe-unity/issues/new)!

#### Solve an Issue

Scan through our
[existing issues](https://github.com/chloe-game/chloe-unity/issues) to find one
that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As
a general rule, if an issue isn't assigned to someone, nobody is working on it
yet.

### Make Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a working branch and start making changes
3. Commit the changes once you are happy with them
4. Create a pull request
   - Don't forget to
     [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
     if you are solving one.
   - Enable the checkbox to
     [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)
     so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a Docs
     team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request
     additional information.
   - We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using
     [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request)
     or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through
     the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to
     your branch.
   - As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as
     [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
   - If you run into any merge issues, checkout this
     [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help
     you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
